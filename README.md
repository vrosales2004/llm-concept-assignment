# Recipe Scaler
A recipe scaler. This concept stores recipes and intelligently scales these recipes to the desired level.

## Concept: Scaler

**Purpose**: Meant to store recipe and scale to the input factor
**Principle**: recipe either manually inputted or uploaded along with scale factor
	    on scale, ingredient counts are scaled by the given factor
	    scale factor and entire recipe context taken into account through LLM when scaling

### Core State
- **Activities**: Set of activities with title, duration, and optional startTime
- **Assignments**: Set of activity-to-time assignments
- **Time System**: All times in half-hour slots starting at midnight (0 = 12:00 AM, 13 = 6:30 AM)

### Core Actions
- `addActivity(title: string, duration: number): Activity`
- `removeActivity(activity: Activity)`
- `assignActivity(activity: Activity, startTime: number)`
- `unassignActivity(activity: Activity)`
- `requestAssignmentsFromLLM()` - AI-assisted scheduling with hardwired preferences

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **TypeScript** (will be installed automatically)
- **Google Gemini API Key** (free at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

## Quick Setup

### 0. Clone the repo locally and navigate to it
```cd intro-gemini-schedule```

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Add Your API Key

**Why use a template?** The `config.json` file contains your private API key and should never be committed to version control. The template approach lets you:
- Keep the template file in git (safe to share)
- Create your own `config.json` locally (keeps your API key private)
- Easily set up the project on any machine

**Step 1:** Copy the template file:
```bash
cp config.json.template config.json
```

**Step 2:** Edit `config.json` and add your API key:
```json
{
  "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

**To get your API key:**
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key and paste it into `config.json` (replacing `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`)

### 3. Run the Application

**Run all test cases:**
```bash
npm start
```

**Run specific test cases:**
```bash
npm run manual    # Manual scheduling only
npm run llm       # LLM-assisted scheduling only
npm run mixed     # Mixed manual + LLM scheduling
```

## Test Cases

The application includes three comprehensive test cases:

### 1. Manual Scheduling
Demonstrates adding activities and manually assigning them to time slots:

```typescript
const planner = new DayPlanner();
const breakfast = planner.addActivity('Breakfast', 1); // 30 minutes
planner.assignActivity(breakfast, 14); // 7:00 AM
```

### 2. LLM-Assisted Scheduling
Shows AI-powered scheduling with hardwired preferences:

```typescript
const planner = new DayPlanner();
planner.addActivity('Morning Jog', 2);
planner.addActivity('Math Homework', 4);
await llm.requestAssignmentsFromLLM(planner);
```

### 3. Mixed Scheduling
Combines manual assignments with AI assistance for remaining activities.

## Sample Output

```
ðŸ“… Daily Schedule
==================
7:00 AM - Breakfast (30 min)
8:00 AM - Morning Workout (1 hours)
10:00 AM - Study Session (1.5 hours)
1:00 PM - Lunch (30 min)
3:00 PM - Team Meeting (1 hours)
7:00 PM - Dinner (30 min)
9:00 PM - Evening Reading (1 hours)

ðŸ“‹ Unassigned Activities
========================
All activities are assigned!
```

## Key Features

- **Simple State Management**: Activities and assignments stored in memory
- **Flexible Time System**: Half-hour slots from midnight (0-47)
- **Query-Based Display**: Schedule generated on-demand, not stored sorted
- **AI Integration**: Hardwired preferences in LLM prompt (no external hints)
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents overlapping activities
- **Clean Architecture**: First principles implementation with no legacy code

## LLM Preferences (Hardwired)

The AI uses these built-in preferences:
- Exercise activities: Morning (6:00 AM - 10:00 AM)
- Study/Classes: Focused hours (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM)
- Meals: Regular intervals (breakfast 7-9 AM, lunch 12-1 PM, dinner 6-8 PM)
- Social/Relaxation: Evenings (6:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
- Avoid: Demanding activities after 10:00 PM

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not load config.json"
- Ensure `config.json` exists with your API key
- Check JSON format is correct

### "Error calling Gemini API"
- Verify API key is correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure API access is enabled in Google AI Studio

### Build Issues
- Use `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
- Check that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

## Next Steps

Try extending the DayPlanner:
- Add weekly scheduling
- Implement activity categories
- Add location information
- Create a web interface
- Add conflict resolution strategies
- Implement recurring activities
